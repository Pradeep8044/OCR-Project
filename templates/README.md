This Flask application utilizes Azure's Computer Vision service to extract text from uploaded images. Users can upload an image containing text, and the application will process the image, extract the text using Azure's Computer Vision API, and display the extracted text back to the user. The application provides a simple web interface for text extraction, making it easy for users to utilize the power of optical character recognition (OCR) technology.
